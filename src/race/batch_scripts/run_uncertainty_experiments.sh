# Notes (mostly for me)
# $! Contains the process ID of the most recently executed background pipeline 
# $? This the exit status of the last executed command  
# The linux trap command allows you to catch signals and execute code when they occur
# SIGINT is generated when you type Ctrl-C at the keyboard to interrupt a running script 


# kill -INT $pid sends the "interrupt" signal to the process with process ID pid. 
# However, the process may decide to ignore the signal, or catch the signal and do 
# something before exiting and/or ignore it.
